## How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Java 17 or later installed
- Operating system: Windows (classic Command Prompt preferred for UTF-8 compatibility)

### Instructions:
1. **Double-click** the `run.bat` file  
   *(or run it manually from the Windows Command Prompt)*
2. The script will:
    - set the console to UTF-8 encoding (`chcp 65001`)
    - compile all source files into the `out/production/Library_management` folder
    - run the program starting from the `app.Main` class
3. **Tip:** For better readability, press `Alt + Enter` to switch to full-screen console mode

## Data Format

CSV and TXT files in the `config/` folder store the data:

- `books.csv`:
  ```
  id;title;author;publishingHouse;year;borrowerId
  ```
- `readers.csv`:
  ```
  id;firstName;lastName;birthDateYear;birthDateMonth;birthDateDay;borrowedBooksID
  ```
- `libraryName.txt`:
  ```
  My Library Name
  ```

---

## Encoding and Compatibility

- All source files and CSV data are saved in UTF-8
- For correct display of Polish characters, the following are required:
    - Console code page set to 65001
    - JVM encoding flag: `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8`
- These are automatically configured in the `run.bat` script
